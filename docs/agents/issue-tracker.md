# Issue tracker: Linear

Issues and PRDs for this repo live in **Linear**, project **"Mantle Router Algorithm Optimizer"**, team
`Whisker-Personal`.

Project binding (preserve on template updates): project UUID
`29829418-7ca6-43c9-bf03-a49f05c76b1a`, team UUID
`37abcce9-0070-470b-a57b-d8213047c418`, prefix `WHI`, pipeline
`router-algorithms-optimizer` (`3ae52bda-d2f7-4a18-9cd7-15dff9f8a8ed`). Discover actual
Release IDs through the API; template v0.2 is a workflow-contract version, not a product
Release assignment.

## How to reach Linear

Tracker state moves in lockstep with the PR (below), so this access path is **mandatory,
not a convenience** — a runtime that cannot reach the tracker cannot complete the git
workflow. Take the first rung of this ladder that your runtime actually offers:

1. **Linear MCP tools.** In this template's reference setup they are exposed via the
   `slim-tools` gateway rather than as top-level tools:
   - Discover the tool you need:
     `discover_tools({ query: "linear <capability>", detail: "typescript" })`
     (e.g. `"linear create issue"`, `"linear list issues"`, `"linear comment"`).
   - Call it from `execute_code` using the returned `codeApi.path`. Aggregate/filter in
     the sandbox; return only the final shape.

   If your runtime has the Linear MCP server mounted directly, the tool names below apply
   without the gateway indirection.
2. **Linear GraphQL API** over plain HTTP, with `LINEAR_API_KEY` from `.env`. Every
   operation named below exists as a GraphQL mutation/query (`issueCreate`,
   `issueUpdate`, `commentCreate`, `issues`, `workflowStates`). Use this when your runtime
   has shell/network access but no MCP.
3. **Neither available:** stop and report the step as blocked. Do **not** switch to a
   local-markdown tracker or `gh issue` — the tracker is shared state, and a divergent
   shadow copy is worse than an honest block. A project that genuinely uses another
   tracker replaces **this file** with a binding for it, so every skill agrees on where
   issues live. That binding must define the same operations, including
   [§ Release ↔ version binding](#release--version-binding) (or declare that it has no
   release entity — git routing reads that section) and
   [§ Release orchestration document](#release-orchestration-document).

Verify every operation you rely on — Release lookup, issue ↔ Release binding, native
relations, documents — against the target workspace's actual tools or API before depending
on it. Do not guess from a field name. A write you could not confirm is reported as not
done.

The rest of this file names Linear MCP tools (namespace `linear`); under rung 2, read each
as its GraphQL equivalent. Tool names and argument shapes differ between servers and
versions, so **discover the schema first** and use the calls below only where it matches.

### Reference calls (Linear MCP)

These were checked against the reference Linear MCP server. "Exercised" means a real call
succeeded; "schema-verified" means the argument or field was confirmed in the tool schema
but not called.

| Need | Call | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Page through a project's or Release's issues | `list_issues({ project, release, limit, cursor })` — repeat with the returned `cursor` while `hasNextPage` | exercised |
| One issue with its Release and native relations | `get_issue({ id, includeRelations: true, includeReleases: true })` → `releases[]`, `relations.blocks` / `relations.blockedBy` | exercised |
| Bind an issue to a Release | `save_issue({ id, setReleases: [<release>] })` (also `addReleases` / `removeReleases`), then re-read with `get_issue` | exercised |
| Wire native dependencies | `save_issue({ id, blocks: [...], blockedBy: [...] })` | schema-verified, not exercised |
| Find a project document | `list_documents({ projectId, query, limit, cursor, fields })` — the filter is `projectId`, not `project` | exercised |
| Create / update a document | `save_document({ title, project, content })` creates; `save_document({ id, content })` updates | create exercised |

**`list_issues` results do not include Release or relations.** Never infer those from a
list page: call `get_issue` for each issue whose Release or dependencies matter. After a
write, re-read to confirm it.

Other core tools:

- **Create / update an issue**: `linear.save_issue({...})`. When creating, `title` and
  `team` are required; also set `project` to `"Mantle Router Algorithm Optimizer"` so it's scoped
  correctly. Omit `id` on create; pass `id` to update. Use `assignee` (a user id, name,
  email, or `"me"`) — not `assigneeId`. Set labels via the `labels` field (see
  `triage-labels.md` for the canonical strings), the Release via `setReleases`, and
  dependencies via `blocks` / `blockedBy` (table above).
- **Read one issue**: `linear.get_issue({ id, includeRelations: true, includeReleases:
  true })`. **List issues**: `linear.list_issues({...})` with the filters its schema
  offers (project, release, assignee, state, label), paging with `cursor`.
- **Comment**: `linear.save_comment({ issueId, body })` to start a thread;
  `linear.save_comment({ parentId, body })` to reply. Read with
  `linear.list_comments({ issueId })`.
- **Labels**: `linear.list_issue_labels({...})` to find existing labels;
  `linear.create_issue_label({...})` to create a missing one.
- **Workflow states**: `linear.list_issue_statuses({ team })` — Linear tracks progress
  as workflow states in addition to labels. Move an issue by setting its `state` via
  `linear.save_issue`.
- **Close**: set the issue's `state` to a completed/canceled workflow state via
  `linear.save_issue`, optionally after a `linear.save_comment` explaining why.

Prefer Linear's native **workflow states** for lifecycle (open → done) and **labels**
for the triage roles in `triage-labels.md`.

## Issue lifecycle ↔ Git (mandatory)

Implementation always uses a **git worktree** off the **resolved base** (see
`docs/GIT_WORKFLOW.md` — version-scoped work targets `release/v{version}`,
governance targets `dev`, hotfix targets `main`). Agents must keep Linear
state in lockstep with the PR:

| When | Linear `state` |
| --- | --- |
| Claimed, implementation started | `In Progress` |
| PR opened against the resolved base | **`In Review`** |
| PR merged into the resolved base and the required cleanup (and fan-out) done | **`Done`** |
| Waiting for a human, or verification failed | stays **`In Review`**, reason in a comment |
| Abandoned | `Canceled` |

**Who moves it.** Under `/orchestrate` the orchestrator owns every transition; implementers
return facts and PR links. In standalone `/implement`, the implementing agent owns them.
`Done` means merged, not released.

Do not mark `Done` when the PR is only opened, or because an agent reported it finished.
Do not leave an open PR in `In Progress`. If a PR opened before the orchestrator heard
about it, sync the state as soon as it does. On resume, read the real PR state first and
repair drift — never re-create or re-merge a PR. Triage labels (`ready-for-agent`, etc.)
stay orthogonal to these states.

## Release ↔ version binding

`docs/GIT_WORKFLOW.md` § Version determination resolves a version-scoped issue's
base branch from two signals: the `[X.Y.Z]` title prefix (primary) cross-checked
against **this tracker's release entity**. That entity is tracker-specific, so it
is defined here.

**For Linear, the release entity is the issue's `Release` field.** Sharp edges,
all of which have already caused a real mis-resolution in the source project
(`mantle-stocks-arbitrage-bots`, WHI-1097):

- **`Release` is not `projectMilestone`.** Both render as a bare `X.Y.Z` in the
  UI and in API payloads, and reading the milestone as the Release let a title
  prefix of `[0.2.0]` sit against a milestone of `0.3.0` undetected for days.
  Milestone is *capability stage*; Release is *when it ships* and what routes
  git (`docs/GIT_WORKFLOW.md` § Version axis).
- **Linear does not enforce non-empty fields.** `issue-template.md`'s metadata
  table asks for a Release, but nothing rejects an issue without one — several
  shipped with the field empty. The enforcement is the agent's **refusal**, not
  the tracker.
- **Read it through the same access ladder as everything else** (above): via MCP,
  `get_issue({ id, includeReleases: true })` and read `releases[]` (a list page does not
  carry it); under rung 2, the GraphQL `issue` query — select the release field
  explicitly and confirm you did not select the milestone by accident. If the tracker is unreachable, the
  cross-check has not been performed: say so and stop, rather than proceeding on
  the title prefix alone as though both signals had agreed.

**Swapping trackers:** a replacement binding for another tracker must define this
section too — naming its own release
entity and how to read it — or state explicitly that it has **no** release
entity, which drops the cross-check per `docs/GIT_WORKFLOW.md` § Version
determination and leaves the title prefix standing alone. A missing or ambiguous
prefix still refuses.

## Pull requests as a triage surface

**PRs as a request surface: no.** Code review happens on GitHub; the Linear queue is not
fed from pull requests.

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create a Linear issue with `linear.save_issue` (`title` + `team` required, `project` set
to `"Mantle Router Algorithm Optimizer"`). Follow the canonical structure in
`docs/agents/issue-template.md` — title convention, body sections, and acceptance
criteria. All issue content is written in English.

## Publishing ticket sets (e.g. from `/to-tickets`)

When a skill produces a **set** of tickets with blocking edges, publish them to Linear
like this:

1. **Order**: create issues in dependency order — blockers first — so each later issue
   can reference real identifiers.
2. **Blocking edges**: wire them as Linear's native **`blocked-by` / `blocks`
   relations** (`save_issue({ id, blocks, blockedBy })`, or the dedicated relation tool
   if your server's schema has one), then confirm with `get_issue({ id,
   includeRelations: true })`. Also mirror
   each edge as a human-readable `## Blocked By` line in the body per
   `issue-template.md`; the native relation is the source of truth, the body line is the
   mirror.
3. **Scoping**: every issue gets `project: "Mantle Router Algorithm Optimizer"` and, if the
   set belongs to a version, the matching **Release** (`setReleases`, confirmed with
   `get_issue({ id, includeReleases: true })`; title carries the `[X.Y.Z]` prefix per
   `issue-template.md`). Milestone is orthogonal — attach it when the
   set is a capability stage, but do not put it in the title.
4. **State + labels**: state `Todo`, triage label `ready-for-agent` (unless the user
   says otherwise) — the tickets are agent-grabbable by construction.
5. **Body**: use the copy-paste skeleton in `issue-template.md`, including a filled
   `## Execution` section (one complexity value, reason, expected scope).

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Read it with `linear.get_issue({ id, includeRelations: true, includeReleases: true })`,
then pull discussion with `linear.list_comments({ issueId })`.

## Adoption of completed legacy work

The existing 0.1.0 implementation predates this workflow contract. Do not reopen or
rewrite completed issues merely to add `## Execution`. Recover their actual scope and
acceptance from committed PRs/evidence for release review, recording the legacy contract.
New work and unfinished issues selected for scheduling need Complexity/Reason/Expected
scope first; do not invent missing metadata or silently dispatch them at default effort.

WHI-1425 is a completed governance bootstrap issue historically associated with Release
0.1.0 at the owner's request. Preserve that dated metadata exception when reconstructing
the release; it is not a model for new governance issues and must not be dispatched as
unversioned product work. New governance issues carry no Release. Do not start planned
0.1.1 or 0.2.0 product work solely because the template was updated.

## Reading a release

`/orchestrate` works from an explicit project and Release — never a similar title or a
milestone. Page through **every** page of `list_issues({ project, release, limit,
cursor })` until `hasNextPage` is false. Then, for each issue, `get_issue({ id,
includeRelations: true, includeReleases: true })` for its state, `releases[]`,
`relations.blocks` / `relations.blockedBy`, the `## Execution` section and acceptance
criteria, plus `list_comments` for amendments. A list page alone is not enough. Native relations are the dependency source of truth; the body lines
mirror them — fix whichever is wrong before scheduling.

## Release orchestration document

Release-level state lives in **one** Linear project document named
`Release X.Y.Z — orchestration`, reused for the whole release (never one per round) and
linked from the issues it concerns. It records:

- workflow contract version (`v0.2`), and which issues, if any, started under an older one;
- the planned issue set, the fixed review baseline **B** and the integration branch;
- each review round: candidate SHA **H**, reviewer role/model/effort, outcome;
- every finding id → the fix issue that owns it (or its disposition), including
  governance fixes tracked as external blockers (no Release, routed to `dev`);
- current blocker, if any.

Look it up first with `list_documents({ projectId, query: "Release X.Y.Z — orchestration" })`.
Update it with `save_document({ id, content })` (or the server's patch form). Only if none
exists, create it with `save_document({ title, project, content })`, then link it from the
issues. GraphQL equivalents: `documents` / `documentCreate` / `documentUpdate`. If documents cannot be written, say so and stop the step that needed it —
do not keep the state only in chat or a temp file.
